I this lab I learned different decision tree classifiers and performed 5-fold cross-validation on two different
datasets using Pythonâ€™s sklearn library.


Both programs cancerDT.py and votingDT.py must be run with python3 (it was made with and tested with Python 3.5.2 on ubuntu).

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt 

usage:type into terminal: 
python3 cancerDT.py cancerDataSet.csv
python3 votingDT.py votesDataset.csv

the csv files that contain the data are provided in the submission folder
